# Birth Charts

The very moment you leave your mother's womb, the universe was in a unique instant, a combination of all celestial entities in specific positions that never existed before and cannot be reproduced again.&#x20;

In this sense, every human is a unique configuration of attributes. Pretty much as when you are playing videogame and you need to choose your character's characteristics and properties from a very large set of possibilities.

The moment you were born can be mapped and mathematically represented by an astrological chart.

### The 12 sectors in the birth chart wheel

Your birth chart represents the coordinates, or exact location, of your birth place: a two-dimensional representation of Earth at that moment.&#x20;

The 12 slices represent the 12 constellations in the sky (and also the 12 signs of the zodiac). We know that the planets revolve around the Sun, but in astrology, we look at the projection of how the solar system and the main star constellations interplay with us on Earth. From our viewpoint on Earth, the Sun appears to travel around the Earth, passing through each of the 12 zodiac signs.&#x20;

The birth chart represents our view of the sky sliced into 12 sections of 30° degrees, with the whole circle measuring 360°. Each of these sections represents **"The 12 Houses":** the 12 different areas specific to the 12 functions of our life.&#x20;

In the Hero Journey's narrative, each of these 12 sectors is one phase in the whole story, flowing counterclockwise and starting from the first house.

### The ascendant and the first house of self

The sign of your ascendant is defined by the sign on the horizon when you were born. The place where the Earth touches the Sky. That's why you need your exact time and location of birth to define your ascendant.

The ascendant is not only the sign of your first house (or **"The House of Self"**), but also the sign of every house in your chart.&#x20;

Keep in mind that the angle of your ascendant is important too, and we will discuss in the future.&#x20;

### The 12 signs and the hero journey's narrative&#x20;

Note that there is a symmetry between the house number and the narrative of each of the 12 zodiac signs. In the case of the first house, the house of self is represented by the ideals of Aries (so it is also called the **"House of Aries"**). These are how the houses are ruled:

| House number | Ruler |       |
| ------------ | ----- | ----- |
| 1st house    | Aries | House |
|              |       |       |
|              |       |       |

We discuss each houses in details in the next session, but here is a high-level summary of how this works:
