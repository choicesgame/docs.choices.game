# Birth Charts

The very moment you leave your mother's womb, the universe is in a unique instant that never existed before and cannot be reproduced. This moment can be mapped or represented by an astrological chart.

### The 12 sectors

The wheel is two-dimensional representation of Earth. The 12 slices represent the 12 constellations in the sky (the 12 signs of the zodiac). The birth chart represents our view of the sky sliced into 12 section of 30° degrees, with the whole circle measuring 360°. Each of these sections represents **The 12 Houses",** or areas of your life. Each slice (each House) in that circle represents a different area and specific function of your life. We know that the planets revolve around the Sun, but astrology studies how the solar system interplays with us here on Earth. From our viewpoint on Earth, the Sun appears to travel around the Earth, passing through each of the 12 zodiac signs.&#x20;

### The ascendant and the first house of self

Your ascendant is given by the exactly time and location that you were born. It marks where the first house, **"The House of Self"** starts. It's the house of the self, and it's **always the first house.**&#x20;

Your natal chart represents the coordinates, or exact location, of your birth place. The sign of your ascendant is defined by the point where the sign in the horizon when you were born. The place where the Earth touches the Sky. This point defines not only the sign of your first house or "self", but also the sign of every house in your chart. Keep in mind that the angle of your ascendant is important too, and we will discuss in the future.

Note that there is a symmetry between the house number and the narrative of the each sign. In the case of the first house, the house of self is represented by the ideals of Aries (so this is also called the **"House of Aries"**).
