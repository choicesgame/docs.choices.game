# Birth Charts

The very moment you leave your mother's womb, the universe was in a unique instant, a combination of all celestial entities in specifics positions that never existed before and cannot be reproduced again.&#x20;

In this sense, every human is a unique configuration of attributes, pretty much as when you are playing a game and you need to choose your character's attributes and properties from a very large set of possibilities.

This moment can be mapped and mathematically represented by an astrological chart.

### The 12 sectors in the birth chart wheel

The birth chart wheel is two-dimensional representation of Earth. The 12 slices represent the 12 constellations in the sky (and also the 12 signs of the zodiac). We know that the planets revolve around the Sun, but in astrology we look at the projection of how the solar system and the main star constellations interplay with us on Earth. From our viewpoint on Earth, the Sun appears to travel around the Earth, passing through each of the 12 zodiac signs.&#x20;

The birth chart represents our view of the sky sliced into 12 section of 30° degrees, with the whole circle measuring 360°. Each of these sections represents **"The 12 Houses":** the 12 different areas specific to the 12 functions of our life. In the Hero Journey's narrative, each area is one stage in the whole story, flowing counterclockwise and starting from the first house.



### The ascendant and the first house of self

Your natal chart represents the coordinates, or exact location, of your birth place. The sign of your ascendant is defined by the sign in the horizon when you were born. The place where the Earth touches the Sky. That's why you need your exact time and location of birth to define your ascendant.

The ascendant not only the sign of your first house or **"The House of Self"**, but also the sign of every house in your chart. Keep in mind that the angle of your ascendant is important too, and we will discuss in the future.&#x20;

Note that there is a symmetry between the house number and the narrative of the each sign. In the case of the first house, the house of self is represented by the ideals of Aries (so this is also called the **"House of Aries"**).
