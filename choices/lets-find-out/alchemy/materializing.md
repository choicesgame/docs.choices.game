# Manifesting

#### Manifesting is the act of making use of your, or someone's, _will_ together with the _four forces_ of nature to materialize a desired outcome.



### The Only Rule for Manifesting

Do not mess with other people's free will, desires, or choices. Besides this, anything is valid.

If you, however, be prepared to pay a price, as the wheel of fortune turns.
