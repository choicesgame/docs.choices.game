### The One Only Rule for Materializing

_**Do not mess with other people's free will, desires, or choices.**_&#x20;

Besides this, anything is valid.&#x20;

If you, however, be prepared to pay a price, as the wheel of fortune turns. And waste some time on your journey.

If you are diligent in tuning to high frequencies (through working on your spiritual practices and self-love), you will manifest a dreamy life inside this reality.
