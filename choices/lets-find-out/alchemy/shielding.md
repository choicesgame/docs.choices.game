# Shielding

Everything we touch is a type of energy exchange. As you start tuning to higher energies and higher abilities, to be able to progress, you will need to set boundaries from lower vibrations.

You can use artifacts and rituals to work on your shielding (such as sage, epson salt, crystals, etc.), but your mind is what ultimately decides, creates, and maintains these shielding.

The best advice is to cut and block anything that feels intuitively dealigned (or take your mind to other people's will or neurosis). You have the right not to have what you don't want or need inside your life and mind. Just cut it out. Things might change later, and you might review and reshape your shielding. Don't worry about it now; protect what needs to be shielded from now.
