# Shielding

> ðŸ’¡ _<mark style="color:green;">**Everything we touch is a type of energy exchange. As you start tuning to higher energies and higher abilities, to be able to progress, you will need to set boundaries from lower vibrations.**</mark>_

First, you have the right not to hold or care for what you don't want or need inside your life and mind.&#x20;

Second, to be able to master magick, you need to first master **cutting and blocking anything that is intuitively dealigned** (or anything that pulls your mind to other people's will or neuroses).&#x20;

You can use artifacts and rituals to work on your shielding (such as sage, epson salt, stones, etc.), but your mind is what ultimately decides, creates, and maintains the shielding. As you master shielding, you will be able to do it simply with your will.

Here are some ideas to get started:

1. if you can, just cut the cord out: physically block, remove, unfollow.
2. Realize your mind's inertia: every time this person or energy comes to your mind, acknowledge it and then gently, move away to your own thoughts and happy spaces.
3. If you can't cut out physically, for now, make a plan to be able to do this in the future. Do not stand in a situation that chronically attacks your well-being and your free will.
4. Things might change later, and you might review and reshape your shielding. Don't worry about it now; protect what needs to be shielded from now.
