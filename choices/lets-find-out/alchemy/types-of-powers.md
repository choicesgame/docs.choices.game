# Types of Powers

**Psychic powers come from tuning into certain frequencies in this reality. Predisposition to abilities is described in your birth chart configuration, but how you work them out might be the very representation of your free will in this reality.**

## 1. Empathy

* The ability to read other peoples' mind and/or feelings and predict their actions.
* The _classical_ "constant feelings of ups and downs" (until you control your own mind and learn to keep a shield).
* Impressive skills in reading Tarot cards, astrology, or other self-realization tools.
* Weak minds could be torn apart if this skill is not well-managed. On the other hand, if fine tuned, it can be developed on remote viewing or/and prophetic skills.



## 2. Prophecy

* The ability to know/feel for what's going to happen, questioning our own free will.
* It can be expressed by the individual's own creative languages (not only words, but also: images, colors, smells, sensations, pattern recognition, etc.).
* Impressive skills in reading Tarot cards, astrology, or other self-realization tools.
* Can be manifest through prophetic dreams.
* Usually developed by highly intelligent individuals.



## 3. Geomantic empathy

* The ability to feel places, including but not limited to:&#x20;
  * the energy of people who own or live/d there
  * events that happened there.
* Usually developed by highly creative individuals.



## 4. Fire manipulation

* The ability to create, sustain, contain, and vanish fire flames with your thoughts.
* This is a very advanced skill, requiring further empirical research.



## 5. Animal taming

* The ability to create a two-way venue of communication with animals (e.g., birds, cats, bugs, fishes):
  * calling their presence with your thoughts
  * receive warnings or messages from them
  * having them following you or interacting with your thoughts
* Usually developed by individuals that are naturally vegan or vegetarian:
  * the smell of dead animals makes them feel sick
  * the idea of eating animal meat makes them sick



## 6. Spatial bending

* The ability to drastically change how people or things appear.
* The ability to manipulate perception, from a small scale, to a broader permanent reality shifting.
* The ability to create a show (this is the "magician" skill).



## 7. Temporal bending

* The ability to understand steady time as a mere human construct, i.e. comprehension of _timelessness_.
* The ability to move through time in a non-constant speed.
* The ability to communicate to your past and future self.
* The ability to control the speed of time is perceived, on a personal and larger scale.



## ðŸ”¬ Skills still being scrutinized by MAA research

* remote viewing
* manipulation of other elements (earth, air, water)
* transmutation of elements
