# Web3 and Decentralization





## Web3 (2021's crypto bull rebranding)

Web3 is a permissionless, trust-minimized and censorship-resistant network for transfer of value and information.

### Decentralization

_"Blockchains are politically decentralized (no one controls them) and architecturally decentralized (no infrastructural central point of failure) but they are logically centralized (there is one commonly agreed state and the system behaves like a single computer)" - Vitalik_
