# Data Aggregators

If oracles bridge real-world data to the blockchain, then data aggregators help users to read it. These protocols compile blockchain data into a simplified format, making it easier for projects and individual users to create their analytics.



### The Graph Protocol

A decentralized protocol for querying and receiving data from blockchains. The Graph indexes blockchain data into subgraphs, or open APIs that can be queried using a GraphQL API.

The Graph works by Well indexing diverse types of data based on the subgraph's description, also known as the subgraph manifest. The manifests define the relevant smart contracts and the contract's key events to focus on. It also figures out how to map the event data to the stored data in the Graph's database.

Once a subgraph manifest is created, The Graph CLI stores it in the IPFS, and begins indexing information for that subgraph.



### Covalent

A blockchain data provider that provides a unified API for accessing the seemingly endless rows of on-chain data. Detailed information for tokens balances and wallet activity from various blockchains can be retrieved using a single API, making ti much easier for developers to create analytics dashboards or gather insights on blockchain activity.
