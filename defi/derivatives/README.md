# Derivatives

* Perpetual Protocol: decentralized protocol that offers perpetual contract trading, allowing users to open up to ten times leverage long or short positions on various cryptoassets. To achieve this, Perpetual Protocol used a unique approach of virtual AMMs.
* dYdX: decentralized exchange protocol for lending, borrowing, spot trading, margin trading, and perpetual swap trading.

### Synthetic Assets

Synthetic assets are assets or a mixture of assets that have the same value or effect as another asset. Synthetic assets track the value of underlying assets and allow exposure to the assets without the need to hold the actual asset itself.

Examples of synthetic assets include virtually any trackable asset, from real-world stocks to Ethereum gas prices.

* Synthetix: decentralized platform for minting and trading synthetic assets known as Synths, backed by collateral provided by the platform's users. Synth allow users to track the value of an underlying asset without holding the actual asset itself. There are two types of Synths: regular and inverse.
* UMA: decentralized protocol for creating and enforcing synthetic assets on the Ethereum network. UMA provides the infrastructure for building secure financial contracts using two core parts of their technology: a framework for building and deploying the derivatives and also an oracle known as the Data Verification Mechanism to enforce them.
