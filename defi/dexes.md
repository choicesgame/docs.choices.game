# DEXes

A decentralized exchange is a platform allowing tradings and token swaps without the need of an intermediary mediator. They can be two types:

#### Order Book Based

* They operate similarly to centralized exchanges, where users can set sell and buy orders at chosen limit or market prices.
* If on-chain, all orders are recorded on the blockchain. If off-chain, trade orders remain off-chain until they are matched, and then executed on-chain.

#### Liquidity Pool Based

* Liquidity pools are token reserves that sit on smart contracts so user can exchange tokens with.
* Liquidity pools are reserves that hold two or more tokens in a DEX smart contract that are made available for users to trade.
* Usually they use Automated Market Makers (AMM), which are  a series of mathematical functions that define the asset prices.
* Depositors (Liquidity Providers) are the seed for liquidity pools. They deposit their tokens into the liquidity pool based on the predefined token weights for each AMM.

#### Automated Market Makers (AMMs)

Some of the popular AMM formulas:

* Constant Product Market Makers: x \* y = k. Examples: Uniswap and Bancor.
* Constant Mean Market Maker, also known as Value Function, popular by Balance.
