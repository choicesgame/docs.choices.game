# Fixed Interest Rate Protocols

Pursuit of price stability and the stability of financial markets.

FIRPs are a new suite of protocols that are bound to become a staple in the DeFi scene.



* Yield: decentralized lending system that offers fixed-rate lending and interest rate markets using a new kind of token called fyTokens. These are Ethereum-based tokens that may be redeemed for DAI after a predetermined maturity date.
* Saffron.Finance: decentralized yield aggregator for liquidity providers and one of the first protocols to utilize a tranche-based system. Trances are segments create from liquidity pools that are divided by risk, time and maturity.
* Horizon Finance: allows users to create their own markets based on game-theory principles. Game theory envisions an environment where there are only rational actors. Horizon allows users to submit their collateral into a liquidity pool, which is then lent to lending protocols such as Compound. To provide fixed interest rates to users, Horizon invites users to submit their sealed bids for fixed interest rates (acting as yield caps) or floating interest rates in each round.
