# Indices

One way to get cryptocurrency exposure in your investment portfolio without monitoring individual currency's performance is by investing in passively managed portfolios such as decentralized indices, which work similarly to ETFs.

* Index Cooperative (INDEX): the oldest decentralized indices protocol. It enables users to gain broad exposure to different protocols of varying themes across the cryptocurrency industry. Indices token holders can own, have exposure to, and directly redeem the underlying assets that comprise the index.
* Indexed Finance: a protocol that focuses on portfolio management. Users can mint, swap or burn the indices token and the underlying assets, and the integrated AMM mechanism forked from Balancer rebalances its indices automatically.
* PowerPool: smart pools based on Balancer's Automated Market Maker (AMM) with additional  functionality. Its main purpose is to pool governance tokens together for lending, borrowing, and executing meta-goverance.
