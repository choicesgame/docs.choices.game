# Initial DEX Offerings (IDO)

**Initial Bonding Curve Offering (IBCO)**

It tries to prevent front-running practices: as more investors provide capital into the bonding curve, the token price will increase from its initial value.

However, it does not matter when you choose to contribute since all investors will pay based on the same final settlement price.

Based on the price at the end of the IBCO, each investor will receive a portion of the tokens based on their share of the capital invested.

**Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool (LBP)**

LBP is a way for projects to sell tokens using a configurable Automated Market Maker. Usually, these pools would contain the project token and a collateral token, usually denominated in stablecoins.

Controllers of the smart pool can change its parameters and introduce a variety of feature to the sale, such as a declining price over time as well as pausing any further swaps due to high demand or external vulnerabilities.

**Initial Farm Offering (IFO)**

First introduced by PancakeSwap, an IFO allows users to stake their Liquidity Provider tokens in exchange for a project's token. Using an overflow mechanism, users can stake as much or as little as they want. In the event of oversubscription, any excess tokens are returned to the bidder. IFOs on PancakeSwap use CAKE-BNB LP tokens, where the project receives BNB tokens in exchange for their newly minted protocol's token, while the remaining CAKE tokens are burnt.
