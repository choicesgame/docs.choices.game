# Lending

Using cryptocurrencies as collateral, you can borrow from protocols and leverage upon it.

### Compound

Money market protocol, Ethereum-based, where anyone can lend or borrow cryptocurrencies frictionlessly.

Operates as a liquidity pool built on the Ethereum blockchain.



### Maker

The oldest DeFi borrowing protocol. It enables over-collateralized loans by locking more than 30 tokens supported in a smart contract to mint DAI. Besides being a borrowing protocol, Maker also acts as a stablecoin issuer (DAI).



### AAVE

Prominent decentralized money market protocol similar to Compound. Users can lend and borrow 24 different assets on Aave.

Borrowers can take up loans with zero collateral if the borrower repays the loan and any additional interest and fees within the same transaction. Flash loans are useful for arbitrage traders as they are capital-efficient in making arbitrage trades across the various DeFi Dapps.



### CREAM

A compound fork that also services long-tail, exotic, DeFi assets. It's deployed across Ethereum, BSC, and Fantom.



### Anchor

Lending protocol operating on Terra. It gives a 20% yield for UST.



### Alchemix

Introduces self-payable loans without the risk of getting liquidated. Your collateral will be used to earn interest and the interest earned will be used to repay the loan you made.
