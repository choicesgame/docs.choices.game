# Liquidity Mining

Liquidity mining refers to the reward program of giving out the protocol's native tokens in exchange for capital. These tokens usually come with governance rights and may have the possibility of accruing cash flows.

For example, Compound, a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol, gives out COMP tokens to lenders and borrowers to incentivize protocol activity.

Nexus Mutal, a decentralized insurance protocol, has a Shield Mining program that gives out NXM tokens to NXM token holders who stake their capital on specific protocols to open up more insurance cover capacity.

Hegic, a decentralized options protocol, gives rHEGIC tokens to option sellers and buyers to incentivize protocol activity.
