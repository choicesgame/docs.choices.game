# Security

Smart contracts hacks and bugs are still very common.&#x20;

Here is a list of common exploits:

### Economic exploits

Flash loans allow users to leverage limitless capital to carry out a financial transaction as long as the borrower repays the loan within the same transaction.



### Oracle attacks

DeFi protocols need to know asset prices to function correctly. Oracles may be subject to heavy manipulation.



### Tips for security

1. Don't give smart contracts unlimited approval: you can edit permissions in the wallet popup
2. Revoking unlimited approvals from smart contracts: you can use the t[oken approval checker by Etherscan.](https://etherscan.io/tokenapprovalchecker)
3. Use a hardware wallet: where private keys are maintained in a secure offline environment, even if the hardware wallet is plugged into a computer infected with malware.
