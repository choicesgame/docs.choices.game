# Stablecoins

## Centralized Stablecoin

### Tether (USDT)

Centralized stablecoin that first began trading in 2015. It's the first stablecoin in the market. It pegs $1 through a 1:1 collateral system.



## Decentralized Stablecoin

### DAI

Maker is of the DeFi's first attempts at a Decentralized "Central Bank". As a lending protocol, DAI is issued as a byproduct of borrowing demand when collateral (usually ETH) is deposited into Maker vaults.

These vaults are overcollateralized (generally 150% and above), which helps guard against black swan events where the collateral assets drops significantly.



## Algorithmic Stablecoins

Algorithmic stablecoins utilize algorithms to control stablecoin's market structure and the underlying economics, like an automated Federal Reserve.

While most of algorithmic stablecoins are pegged to the US Dollar, some are not, and some even have a floating peg, thereby creating a new type of asset that we would classify as algorithmic stableassets. Unlike algorithmic stablecoins, algorithmic stableassets could be seen as another form of collateral rather than units of accounts.



### Frax Finance

Frax borrows principle from the seigniorage model to create its own unique model whose stablecoin (FRAX) is backed by two types of collateral - fiat-backed centralized stablecoin USDC, and its native share token, Frax Share (FXS). Although Frax currently employs fiat stablecoins as collateral, the protocol does intend to eventually fully diversify into decentralized collateral.



### Fei Protocol

Fei used a partially collateralized system but is instead backed purely by ETH. Fei's stablecoin is pegged to $1.
