# Yield Aggregators



* Yearn Finance: funds are automatically shifted between dYdX, Aave, and Compound as interest rates change between these protocols. Vaults help users to claim liquidity mining rewards and sell the protocol's native tokens for the underlying assets.
* Alpha Finance: introduced leveraged yield farming through their first product Alpha Homora, allowing users to use borrowed capital to increase their exposure in their yield farming activities. It acts as both a lending and yield aggregator protocol.
* Badger Finance: aims to create an ecosystem of DeFi products with the ultimate goal of bringing Bitcoin into Ethereum. It's the first DeFi project that chose to focus on Bitcoin.
* Harvest Finance: started as a Yearn Finance fork, and has been adopted as a fast-moved strategy. It has been releasing new strategies faster than other yield aggregator protocols.
* Pancake Bunny: biggest yield aggregator in the Binance Smart Chain ecosystem. It only provides farms that are based on PanakeSwap.
* AutoFarm: cross-chain yield farming aggregator, supporting Binance Smart Chain and Huobi ECO Chain.
