# Yield Farming

Most DeFi protocols are peer-to-peer financial applications where capital allocated is used to provide services to end-users. The fees charged to users are then shared between the capital providers and the protocol. The fees that capital providers get are the intrinsic yield.

**Examples of yield farming:**

* Exchanges: provide capital for market-making on decentralized exchanges, earning transaction fees in return.
* Lending: provide loans to borrowers, earning an interest.
* Insurance: underwrite insurance, earning premiums while undertaking the risk of paying out claims during disasters.
* Options: underwrite options by selling call and put options to earn yield.
* Synthetic assets: mint stablecoins or other synthetic assets, earning fees in return.

> ðŸ’¡Ideally the exchange must have low latency and deep liquidity so that you have the best price execution and do not get impacted by price slippage.
