## 08/02: a generational <mark style="color:green;">**gnarly Conjunction of Uranus + Mars + the North Node**</mark> at 18 degrees, in Taurus.

* **North Node** expands with restrictions (think Jupiter marries Saturn, or "Wheel of Fortune"); **Uranus** is all the bad/good luck in the world in an unexpected way (think mysterious sudden changes); and **Mars** is the good ol' aggression/yang energy warrior.
* The **rarity** of this combination at 18 degrees in Taurus is \~3000 years, which can be estimated by simply multiplying the planets' returning times:
  * Uranus: 84.01 years
  * Mars: 1.88 years
  * North Node: \~19 years.
* Without such exact conjunction, the rarity of them all chillin' in Taurus can be estimated by simply checking how long a planet spends in each sign (or, at minimum, around 120 years):
  * Uranus spends 7 years in a sign
  * Mars spends 6-7 weeks in a sign
  * North Node spends 18 months in a sign
* Chart configuration for the exact time of this conjunction (ignore houses number and As/Mc/Ic):
