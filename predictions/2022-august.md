## 08/02: a generational <mark style="color:green;">**gnarly Conjunction of Uranus + Mars + the North Node**</mark> at 18 degrees, in Taurus.

### How do I interpret the "planets":

Think:

* **North Node** will expand with restrictions (think Jupiter marries Saturn, or "Wheel of Fortune", or the head of the dragon)
* **Uranus** is all the bad/good luck in the world in an unexpected way (think mysterious sudden changes, or Aquarius vibes)
* **Mars** is the good ol' aggression/yang energy warrior (think forceful movement, or cardinal/catalytic Fire, or ofc Aries vibes)

### How rare is it?

* The **rarity** of this combination at 18 degrees in Taurus is \~3000 years, which can be estimated by simply **multiplying the planets' returning times** (revolution period):
  * Uranus: 84.01 years
  * Mars: 1.88 years
  * North Node: \~19 years.
* Without such exact conjunction, the **rarity** of them all chillin' in Taurus can be estimated by simply checking **how long a planet spends in each** sign (or, at minimum, around 120 years):
  * Uranus: 7 years in a sign
  * Mars: 6-7 weeks in a sign
  * North Node: 18 months in a sign



### More details
